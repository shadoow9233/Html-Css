        Respected sir/madam
        
        With due Respect, I beg to say that I am a student of class 10th in your school. I am not feeling well today and also have some weakness. Hence I request you to please grant me two days leave.
        
        I hope you will consider my application. I will definitely try to remain present after 2 days.
        
        Thanking you.
        
        Yours obediently
